# Governance Analysis: Maturity Model

## Current Level Demonstrated
This project demonstrates a foundational-to-intermediate governance maturity level.

### Foundational
- Baseline standards defined (encryption, tags, versioning)
- Visibility into drift and compliance status

### Intermediate
- Continuous evaluation
- Manual remediation workflow
- Validation via rule re-evaluation

## What “Advanced” Would Look Like
- Automated remediation (Lambda + SSM automation)
- Preventive controls (SCP guardrails to block noncompliant provisioning)
- Multi-account aggregation (AWS Config Aggregators)
- Standardized packaging (Conformance Packs)
- Central reporting (Security Hub integration and dashboards)

## Why This Matters
Mature governance reduces unplanned cost, improves audit posture, and minimizes risk exposure caused by inconsistent provisioning behavior.
